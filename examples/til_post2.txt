Today I learned how to review some else's Open Source project and file issues!

First, I cloned their project on my local machine.

Next, I followed their instructions on how to run the program.

Once I was familiar with how to run the program, I tried to run some edge cases to find bugs.

When I found a bug, I went to the Issues tab of their GitHub project and clicked New issue.

I gave the issue a title and short description as well as a screenshot and submitted the issue.
