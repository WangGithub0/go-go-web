Today I learned how to work with GitHub and VS Code to push changes!

First, I cloned my project to my local machine:
git clone <url>

Next, I checked that I have the most recent changes:
git pull origin

I worked on my project locally and make changes to the project

When I was ready to push changes, I check which files have been changed:
git status

I added the files with changes:
git add <filename>

I made a commit and write a message:
git commit -m <what I have changed>

I pushed my changes to GitHub:
git push origin
